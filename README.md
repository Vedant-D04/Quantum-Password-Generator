# Quantum Password Generator (Qiskit-Based)

This project uses IBMâ€™s Qiskit to generate cryptographically secure passwords via **Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG)**, harnessing quantum mechanics for true randomness. As a passionate explorer of quantum computing, I delve into its transformative applications, especially in cryptography and randomness.

## Randomness Analysis (100 Qubits)

- **#QRNG**: Exhibits high entropy (0.9974) with a slight bias (p = 0.0578) due to quantum noise.
- **#PRNG**: Demonstrates near-perfect randomness (entropy 0.99997) and high uniformity (p = 0.8495).
  
**Comparison**: QRNG ensures true randomness, whereas PRNG delivers better uniformity.

## Use Cases

- **#SecurePasswords & #Cryptography**: QRNG-generated passwords provide a higher level of security.
- **#QuantumSafeSecurity**: Ensures robustness against future quantum attacks.
